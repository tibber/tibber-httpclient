# tibber-httpclient
Http client that is based upon `got` library.

The original tibber-httpclient library is using the deprecated request-promise library. Therefor this library is updated for using `got` under the hood. 
With `got` there is now also support for cancelling requests.

See the unit tests for how to use this library.

All options that can be supplied to instantiation or the HTTP requests are fully compatible with the `got` api.
