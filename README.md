# tibber-httpclient-got
Http client that is based upon `got` library.

The idea is to substitute the tibber-httpclient library that is using the deprecated request-promise library.
Additionally, this http client has with `got` under the hood, support for cancelling requests.

See the unit tests for how to use this library.

All options that can be supplied to the HTTP requests are fully compatible with the `got` api.
